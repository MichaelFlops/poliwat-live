                    <p>Monday 12 46 PM</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at work since 10 AM and have virtually gotten nothing done. (For my job at least).
I can&rsquo;t concentrate to save my life. Today I&rsquo;m going to post some stuff up online to sell.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t work because life is short. I have songs to work on. I can&rsquo;t stop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a slave. I&rsquo;m a slave to the beat.
The family reunion trip changed my mindset. I only need to gather enough resources to live a day at a time. As long as I have my laptop and recording device, I can make music anywhere. Even the library. So the deadline for going on a trip, taking it a day at a time and producing music along the way is January 1st, 2018.</p>

<p>My buddy Rob is possibly hooking it up with a job helping make medical videos in San Francisco. I&rsquo;ll take that in a heartbeat, I can&rsquo;t think straight when it comes to programming right now. The vacation placed me so deep in my own world, the only way to stay sober is to continue being a slave to the beat. I need to forget the illusion in value of achieving security. Security is always there. I will always have some crappy place to sleep and some crappy food to eat. The rest is bonus. That&rsquo;s what it takes for achieving your dreams. One day I will smoke a doob with Seth Rogan and I will make loops with Seth Rogan. I will get a pilot&rsquo;s lisence. I will transcend my humanity. And humor is going to drive the entire way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of leaving this job on the best terms possible.</p>

<p>Next month I&rsquo;ll be moving into Jack&rsquo;s house for the cheap ass price of $200 a month. If I do chores around the house it may possibly be waved. Next month the focus will be two only two things - finishing a useable version of POLIWAT and the Sims Sims play.
Jack and I will perform the play at a theatre, pprobably <a href="https://endgamesimprov.com/">Endgames improv</a>. After that I&rsquo;ll be free to travel. I want to get a backpacking backpack and start on my journey, my soul needs it.</p>
