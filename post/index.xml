      <description>Tuesday 1136 AM
I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be at work by 10 AM. My boss texted me an hour ago then called, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been glued to this track [stefan]() and I worked on early into the morning. The soundscapes are from our professor and mentor David Dunn, and the woman speaking is my relative Cathy Nelson. Her work is so inspiring an entire album could be made from it.</description>

      <description>Monday 12 46 PM
I&amp;rsquo;ve been at work since 10 AM and have virtually gotten nothing done. (For my job at least). I can&amp;rsquo;t concentrate to save my life. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to post some stuff up online to sell.
I can&amp;rsquo;t work because life is short. I have songs to work on. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop.
I&amp;rsquo;m a slave. I&amp;rsquo;m a slave to the beat. The family reunion trip changed my mindset.</description>

####I was just about damn late to the train
Well I was 11 minutes late, but lucky for me I ride Amtrak and they are always late. I even had a few minutes to spare. I forgot my belt, my dad gave me his. I love him so much.</description>

      <description>Sunday 1134 AM A golden rule of writing is to choose specific over vague. The drunk shaman would not appreciate my sharing about them online so I will be vague. You are unstoppable when you have a drunken shaman.
Instead of talking about it I&amp;rsquo;m working on a track. This is the master doc for lyrics and iterations on the music.

      <description>Another unfinished project, but the idea is
song involving the final stage of life, and the lryics are basically your final will and testament. I imagine myself would be angry on my deathbed, and anger is an abstraction from fear. I have too many ideas to execute in one life, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m angry.
I&amp;rsquo;m freestyling on this version. I was actually lying down on my back, in the dark.</description>

      <description>Friday 620 pm
Peter hasn&amp;rsquo;t called back again - I called him yesterday.
Chad said he was going to be home in 30 and we were going to walk the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s dogs together. He never showed up and I&amp;rsquo;ve called 3 times. I&amp;rsquo;m very depressed. It&amp;rsquo;s day 2 of sobriety, and my only drug has been in how the day was spent. I worked on the Betts family renunion album from 8am - 6pm.</description>

      <description>I wish I could share my favorite tape. I wish I could even state what&amp;rsquo;s on the tape as well. But what&amp;rsquo;s life without secrets? I&amp;rsquo;ll take the USGOV approach. In 20 years it won&amp;rsquo;t matter so it will be the declassified tapes.
In the meantime I will share a gem I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget - Tommy Betts the man who mentored my dad in music, and my father. I&amp;rsquo;m playing some piano in the background, and the recorder I left on their table.</description>

      <description>Brian me and Miles went to a Poetry night in Marquette. 3 cousins! That&amp;rsquo;s a novel experience for me so it was quite exciting. Brian and I each spat a poem, and this is the only place that will have audio from that night. Brian is a good writer and him and him and I both share the schizo gene.

      <description>My dad and I went to checkout a guitar on craigslist today. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;instrumental&amp;rsquo; that we get a guitar on this trip, because the magic and emotions have been running high so far.
We had a great time with him, spent 20 minutes cracking jokes and BSing. Erik is hilarious. Towards the end of the transaction, Erik handed me the jacket seen in the picture above. It is my new favorite jacket, and I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating my next track to Erik.</description>

I learned a sure of a hell of a lot about the Betts family
Tommy Betts mentored my dad in guitar. Another relative said he came over to Tommy&amp;rsquo;s house one day and said to him at the door &amp;ldquo;Do you drink?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Do you fuck?&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Got audio of the Lake Superior. A new goal I have is to release my first album on spotify, and it&amp;rsquo;s will simply be an album of different bodies of water I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded 🔥💧😂.
This morning was monumental. I met the most family members in my entire life. We hit the bar Flannigan&amp;rsquo;s ( right next door to the house my dad gew up in ) then the graveyard. That&amp;rsquo;s my grandparents graves on my dad&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>Just jumped in the ocean and practiced handstands. This guy showed me how to go from your butt to a handstand There are different types of breathing.
 Square breathing
  In middle school my therapist (whose email was hypnohupp) taught me square breathing.
You inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10, exhale for 10, hold for 10, rinse and repeat.
I like to start at 5 seconds and then increase the time after a few cycles through.</description>

My cat died a few a couple months ago. It occurred around the time that %^&amp;amp;#$% broke up with me. I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked about it since, but being home the past few days I was reminded how much I missed her. { The cat, not my X }

I got her though  this was recorded on the sixth floor of a stairwell at my uni dorms. I was messing with a made-up, by ear tuning. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what key this is. I&amp;rsquo;m tone deaf.</description>

Since you&amp;rsquo;re constrained to the reality of our politics, biology, and paradigms; such as religion, capitalism, etc.
current state  I got the idea at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house, when I took an image of her sonogram and ran it through a max msp patch that converted the image data to MIDI.</description>

      <description>300 gigs of my own personal audio recordings. Saturday 116 AM
The biggest treasure of my life is my recordings. I collect audio every day. Normal slice of life things. I constantly record people without them knowing. I call it guerilla audio, and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop. You can tell me it&amp;rsquo;s immoral, illegal, douchie, lock me up, kick my ass, and I still won&amp;rsquo;t stop. Strong words have been tossed between friends and family, and every once in a while someone tries to speak against it.</description>

      <description>the center of github
 I have a romantic thought. What’s at the center of Github? I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it’s stems available on github.
My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven’t gone beyond doodling.</description>

      <description>Friday 533 PM | OnCalTrain | JULY 28 2017 | #####I your therapist at wits end
Had 1 beer @ [jack&amp;rsquo;s]() house and we livestreamed the Sims 3 on Twitch as prep for our play. Just wanted to report on an occurrence that happened a couple months ago. After my last breakup, I went a little off the rails. No, not talking ruby, I maintained a healthy ecosystem of smoke and drink each day.</description>

      <description>I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.</description>

A major client we have here has a major page down for their international (french site). I really had to shit and drink coffee so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t much help and now I should be working on fixing that, but am also consulting my buddy tyler on some flexbox use for a client of his.
Going to Michigan on Tuesday, so real quick notes, these things have to happen today -</description>

      <description>Bounce hour
Every week at my work there&amp;rsquo;s an hour where you can share your projects / ideas over free coffee and snacks. I go for the free coffee and snacks.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any new ideas but listening to all my unfinished beats.
// need to make more music
 Yesterday I failed at making live loops because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have good old DJ Chad Mike hitting record for me.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to type anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sober for a full 7 days now, and I&amp;rsquo;m pissed. I am angry. I will use this anger to get shit done, like log work hours, work on music
Todd hooked me up big time at the fab lab, and I met Chris and Jordan. Chris Maddox printed the first versions of POLIWAT for me and I&amp;rsquo;m super amped on it.</description>

I have been completely sober for 5 days Tuesday 952 PM
At Diridon in San Jose. Hopefully the 17 bus comes and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to my place in Santa Cruz before midnight. My laptop charging porter burned out while on the train so this is the last charge until I repair it. I found a shop in San Jose that has a new pot I can install myself for 40 bucks.</description>
